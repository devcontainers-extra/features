You can\nsearch for database schema objects using regular expressions, and output the\nschema and data in a readable text format. The output serves for database\ndocumentation, and is designed to be diff-ed against other database schemas.\nSchemaCrawler also generates schema diagrams. You can execute scripts in any\nstandard scripting language against your database. You can find potential schema\ndesign issues with lint.",
