# Bower (via npm) (bower)

Bower offers a generic, unopinionated solution to the problem of front-end package management, while exposing the package dependency model via an API that can be consumed by a more opinionated build stack.

## Example Usage

```json
"features": {
    "ghcr.io/devcontainers-extra/features/bower:1": {}
}
```

## Options

| Options Id | Description | Type | Default Value |
|-----|-----|-----|-----|
| version | Select the version to install. | string | latest |
